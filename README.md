## Introduction
Education system forms the backbone of every nation.And hence it is important to provideastrong educational foundation to the young generation to ensure the development of open-minded global citizens securing the future for everyone. Advanced technology available today can playacrucial role in streamlining education-related processes to promote solidarity among students,teachers, parents and the school staff. 

School Management System consists of tasks such as registering students,attendance record keeping controlling absentees,producing report cards,producing official transcript,preparing timetable and producing different reports for teachers and parents. 

* __Computerization__ – All the details regarding school, whether it is small or big, will be computerized. 

* __No Redundant Data__ – As this management system will be centralized, the chances of duplicate data in the system are close to nil. 

* __Automation__ – The automation feature of this management system will mitigate the task of writing the papers. E.g., there is no need to write the report card of the students on paper with a pen. It is simply can be done online on the system, and can be forwarded to the students and their parents. 

* __Easy Interaction__ – In today’s rush hour of life, it is difficult for a parent to go to the school of his / her child every time a teacher call. With this management system, it will easier for a parent and a teacher to be in touch every day. As a matter of fact, it will be easier for each individual person who is associated with the system to be in touch as needed.

## Machine learning analysis
Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), is becoming increasingly popular and is gaining acceptance in almost every area. The main purpose of machine learning is to allow the computer to automatically learn and perform actions without human assistance and to tailor actions accordingly. The introduction of machine learning in schools transforms traditional learning methods with physical books into online learning. In addition, the teacher never has to keep records of each student. In fact, the machine can deliver the concepts and set goals for each student. Not only do the machines aim to show the students’ level they also provide feedback through analysis of the data and their recent work. The machines are based on the student progress analysis program. The same procedure will apply to teachers so that a teacher can also know where to change his work. During this time, students learn about their knowledge gaps, areas where improvements are needed, and methods to get better results. 
Automating and operationalizing this process is difficult. For example, a data scientist must code the model, select parameters and a runtime environment, train the model on batch data, and monitor the process to troubleshoot errors that might occur. This process is repeated iteratively on different parameters and machine learning algorithms, and after comparing the models on accuracy and performance, the model can then be deployed.

* __Model Store and Trained Model Store__: SQL Server can efficiently store a table of “pre-baked” models of commonly used machine learning algorithms that can be trained on various datasets (school management system), as well as trained models for deployment against a live stream for real-time data. 
* __Monitoring service and Model Metadata Store__: SQL Server can provide a service that monitors the status of the machine learning model of the school management system during its execution on the runtime environment for the user, as well as any metadata about its execution that is then stored for the user. 
* __Templated Model Interfaces__: SQL Server can store interfaces that abstract the complexity of machine learning algorithms, allowing users to specify the inputs and outputs for the model.
* __Runtime Verification (for External Runtimes)__: SQL Server can provide a runtime verification mechanism using a stored procedure to determine which runtime environments can support a model prior to execution, helping to enable faster iterations for model training. 
* __Deployment and Scheduler__: Using SQL Server’s trigger mechanism, automatic scheduling and an extended stored procedure you can perform automatic training, deployment and scheduling of models on runtime environments, obviating the need to operate the runtime environments during the modeling process. 
## ML Model Performance: 
* __Fast training and scoring of models using operational analytics__ (in-memory OLTP and in-memory columnstore). 
* __Monitor and optimize model performance via Query store and DMVs__: Query store is like a “black box” recorder on an airplane. It records how queries have executed and simplifies performance troubleshooting by enabling you to quickly find performance differences caused by changes in query plans. The feature automatically captures a history of queries, plans, and runtime statistics, and retains these for your review. It separates data by time windows, allowing you to see database usage patterns and understand when query plan changes happened on the server. 
* __Hierarchical model metadata (that is easily updateable) using native JSON support__: Expanded support for un-structured JSON data inside SQL Server enables you to store properties of your models using JSON format. Then you can process JSON data just like any other data inside SQL. It enables you to organize collections of your model properties, establish relationships between them, combine strongly-typed scalar columns stored in tables with flexible key/value pairs stored in JSON columns, and query both scalar and JSON values in one or multiple tables using full Transact-SQL. You can store JSON in In-memory or Temporal tables, you can apply Row-Level Security predicates on JSON text, and so on.
* __Temporal support for models__: SQL Server 2016’s temporal tables can be used for keeping track of the state of models at any specific point in time. Using temporal tables in SQL Server you can: (a) understand model usage trends over time, (b) track model changes over time, (c) audit all changes to models, (d) recover from accidental model changes and application errors.

## Summary
Although machine learning and artificial intelligence are advancing rapidly in the marketplace, the sector has not paid particular attention to the impact on policy and employment. However, resources are organized and simplified in a refined model of machine learning. 
Machine learning is the new way to accelerate progress in the education system. This allows students to make the learning process more entertaining and challenging through AI technologies. With increasing class size, machine learning can help teachers pay more attention to each student. This will take our education system to a whole new level as schools introduce it into their programs. With the improvement of machine learning technology, the impact on the education system will be even greater. And we hope for a positive effect on the future of education.
